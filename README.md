# Reddit-Twitter API üê¶

This is a project that uses tweepy and praw APIs to tweet out the top-rated (hottest) memes onto a twitter account.
During quarantine, I wanted to make something that could uplift people and make people smile. And I thought that memes are a great universal connector for laughter and joy, so I wanted to bring quality memes to more people on different social media platforms using this project.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites üíª

For this project to run, you will need to install praw, tweepy, and python-dotenv packages.
These packages can be installed by going to Settings/Preferences > Interpreter Settings. From there, click the "+" button and search for those packages in the search bar, and install.
